<h1>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
<p>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
     to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits 
     traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.The ideal characteristic of artificial
      intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific
       goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer
        programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning
         techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, 
         images, or video.

<p>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines
     capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with
      multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in
       virtually every sector of the tech industry.
